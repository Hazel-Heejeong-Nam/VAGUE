## Inference

### Environments
All the open-source models we used are supported by `vllm`.

```bash
conda create -n vague python=3.12 -y
conda activate vague
pip install bert-score nltk # for eval

# Install vLLM with CUDA 12.1.
pip install vllm 

# Install vLLM with CUDA 11.8.
export VLLM_VERSION=0.6.1.post1
export PYTHON_VERSION=310
pip install https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/releases/download/v${VLLM_VERSION}/vllm-${VLLM_VERSION}+cu118-cp${PYTHON_VERSION}-cp${PYTHON_VERSION}-manylinux1_x86_64.whl --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
